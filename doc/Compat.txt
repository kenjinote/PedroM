 JezzBall v1.8				Many graphical bugs due to a bug in JezzBall (DrawSprite add d2.l but it wan't cleared ! In AMS, some functions may return d1.hw= 0 , so). Fixs it it in PedroM by returning d1.l=0 in DrawStr (...)

 CalcRogue				Crash if you call the PPG directly or try to run the unppg version (<= It didn't check the return value of LoadDll, since PedroM didn't run the program from the ghost space). Otherwise, it works !
 CalcWars				Ok (The Grays blink a lot more than on AMS when you moved the cursor).
 Arena3D				Ok but it uses a HeapAlloc(HeapMax()) to manage a file. This call reserve all the memory, and SymAdd may fail after. Not a really bug in PedroM since it mays occur on AMS too !
